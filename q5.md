a) 
i) 
Development Team: Developer, Tester.

Operation Team: Network Technician, System Adminstator, Database Adminstator

ii) Development team goes for new changes. This new changes can be a bug fix, new feature or a requested changes.

Operation team wants a stable working software and prefers less or no changes. Their goal is to make sure the software is stable and operating. They fear that newly introducted changes will make the software unstable and not working whci can affect the bussiness operation.

iii) 
Ways to reduce: 
<list>
1. Reduce the gap between operational team and development team.
2. Have a staging environment or a test environment similar to the production environment for the developer to test the deployment of the new changes.
3. Use vagrant to make sure the developed new features can work on both development machine and production environment.
4. Apply CI tools to bring more confidence from the development team to operational team.
5. Push changes in a small patches so that reverting it will be smooth.

i)
There will be two similar production servers. The one that users will be using currently is blue server. Software with new changes is deployed into green server. Once green server is working and passing smoke tests, the requests goimg to blue server is now directed to green server. The blue server now will be used for upcoming projects.

We will need to ready two ready similar production servers. Production level tests should be carried out first.

ii) The release is tested on production environment, not in local environment. If it passes on production environment, the software is ready.

Deploying is easier as we don't have to touch the existing servers and just just need to redirect the request once green server is ready.

Easier to switch back to blue server if green server fails.
