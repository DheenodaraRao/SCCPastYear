2. Host the source code in a central repository which preferably remote.
3. Automated build.
4. Automated unit test and integration test.
5. Automated static code analysis.
6. Code quality analysis.
7. Run build, test in local macheine before pushing it into central repo.
8. Don't push broken build.

</list>

iii) 
<list>

i)Virtual machine is a machine that runs like a physical machine on a host machine by using virtualization technology. It uses host machine resources to behave like a actual physically running machine.
