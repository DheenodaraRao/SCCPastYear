1. Performing actions other than pushing and pulling is very fast as you are accessing hard drive not remote server(CVS).
2. Actions other than pushing and pulling doesn't require internet connections and you can make many changes and commits rather than a single big commit which is highly not recommended.
3. You will have all metadata and full history of the changes of the project.
4. Sharing and reviewing changes is a lot easier before merging the changes.
5. There is no single remote server hosting the central repo for DVC while there is one for the CVC. Every developer will have a copy of the project in their working device.
