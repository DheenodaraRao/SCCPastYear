a) 
<list>
1. Every developer has a local repo. This means branch switching is easier and faster and they have whole git history which they can use immediately. 
2. Every developer can make as many commits locally before pushing to the central repository. This means developer can work offline and compare their work with others before pushing into a central repo.
</list>

b) i) In the folder which git is init.It can track all folders/file from that level

ii) To ignore files from being tracked. Especially when you stage files with this command git add ., files specified in gitignored will not be tracked, others will. 

Keep in gitignore: Reproducible files, exe files, build files, files which can be reproduced with the build commands.
Not to keep in gitignore: Source code, files that is not a output of build but a base for the build. Files which changes is made on it.

iii) git pull is combination of git fetch and git pull. It will fetch/download the copy of the repo or branch and merge it with the local repository.

git fetch only fectches the branch but only for viewing. Its for viewing lattest changes done on the remote branch and it is harmless to the local repo.

c)

</code>

d) 
```git
//assuming the repo is up to date
git checkout develop
git merge newIdea
git branch -d newIdea
```
